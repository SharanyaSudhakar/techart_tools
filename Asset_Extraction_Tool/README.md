# Asset Extraction

This script was written to walk every asset and extract key files like pngs, tifs and shaders to be exported as a single package for external partner consumption.
The scripts walks every car part associated, export the fbxes, material pngs and shader sample tifs along with a json file that contains the information for how these assets get mapped within the whole systems and what parameters and properties they contain within this system.

A [sample output jpg](https://github.com/SharanyaSudhakar/techart_tools/blob/master/Asset_Extraction_Tool/scrrenshot-output.JPG)  shows the final result <br>
There is a snippet to the wiki documentation I wrote on how to use this tool and how it works and what are the pre-reqs.<br>
a sample json file has also been added to show how information is written
